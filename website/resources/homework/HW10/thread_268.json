  "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>Problem Context: First, you will try to evaluate the difficulty of problems by training a classifier on learned representations by a neural network. Then, you will show how predicting difficulty can be used for \"early-exiting\" to improve inference time. Much of this problem was inspired by <link href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09647\">this paper</link> and <link href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01686\">this paper.</link> </paragraph><paragraph/><figure><image src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/gphs8phQ0SZQwqf2za88TQAZ\" width=\"658\" height=\"575.2690058479533\"/></figure></document>",
