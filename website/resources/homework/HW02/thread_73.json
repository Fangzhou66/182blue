(1) While within the overall optimization theme, it hits material that has not been covered in lecture and discussion. This is intentional. Our learning objective is to have you be able to learn stuff on your own after this course is done. So we need to practice that too. The problem is carefully curated so you can learn as you work through it. (2) It is a part of our attempt to gently expose you to core ideas related to reinforcement learning with the objective of making sure that by the end of the semester, you have the mental tools to properly understand post-training of foundation models for LLMs. We take an optimization perspective here to bring out how randomness can help smooth things in a helpful manner. </paragraph></document>",

Are we supposed to compute f^{\\hat}{\\sigma}(x,y) with these? But then don't we also need to do samples about (x+\\delta, y) and (x, y+\\delta) to have the required f^{\\hat}{\\sigma} values to compute \\frac{\\partial f_{\\sigma}(x,y)}{\\partial x}? I figured we would just do this part by reusing the f^{\\hat}_{\\sigma}(x,y) values that we computed for part 2, but then I don't see the need for tx and ty. I must be missing something.
