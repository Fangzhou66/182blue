  "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>Problem Context: This is a former exam problem. It is meant to setup transformers by connecting attention to classical learning approaches, specifically ridge regression. The problem is a conceptual bridge between recurrent models and transformers. Though the problem references transformers, you should be able to solve it with what you have learned thus far. This should both help further demystify why transformers are able to do in-context learning as well as help you understand why recurrent models can have the same capability. </paragraph><figure><image src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/WCaQfIM7e4U4uEHcdB7oVvTU\" width=\"658\" height=\"753.2659932659932\"/></figure><figure><image src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/VadJylV2GkEEUd7fIEdIbcAs\" width=\"658\" height=\"788.7564102564103\"/></figure></document>",
